## **Project Goal**

A command-line tool that lets developers:

* Save, tag, and organize code snippets.
* Search and retrieve snippets quickly.
* Sync snippets locally (with optional remote storage later).
* Integrate with editors/IDEs.

Think of it as an **offline, developer-friendly clipboard + snippet library**.
